# Claim_Based_CNN
Use open source CMS medical claim to build a CNN based deep model to predict diabetes onset <br />
PyTorch is used for this project. <br />
Only a part of codes are presented becaused it's a unpublished work yet. <br />
Codes are in development format and have not optimized. Comments are removed on purpose for the same reason. <br />
<br />
*Word2Vec_Claim*: customized word2vec model trained with medical claims.<br />
<br />
*CNN_Model*: employed CNN model to predict a binary outcome, diabetes onset for the next 12 month in this example, using medical claims with different settings on stride, dilation and network structure.
